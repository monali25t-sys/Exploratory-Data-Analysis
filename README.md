# Project

This project explores the dataset of 1000 most popular movies during the period of 2006-2016. The project is divided into 5 main components:

- Problem Statement
- Data Wrangling
- Questions and EDA
- Conclusion
- Communicate

# Components
## Problem Statement
After collecting some initial questions, I came up with a hypothetical problem: In 2017, a certain production company, ABC decides to produce movies that will earn the best in terms of revenue, popularity and acclaim. This company approaches agency, XYZ and asks them to come up with characteristics of movies that will help them achieve their purpose.

## Data Wrangling
I gathered the data, examined and cleaned it to make it ready for EDA.

## Questions and EDA
Then I added more questions that aligns with the Problem Statement. Used these questions to explore the data using descriptive statistics and visualization. Noted down my findings from the exploration.

## Conclusion
I drew conclusions from my data exploration in this section.

## Communicate
Finally, I communicated my results through Presentation and Voice Overlay.

# 1. Problem Statement
In 2017, a certain production company, ABC decides to produce movies that will earn the best in terms of revenue, popularity and acclaim. This company approaches agency, XYZ and asks them to come up with characteristics of movies that will help them achieve their purpose. Agency gives the task to Nitin. He is given the IMDB database of 1000 movies for the last 10 years (2006-2016). His task is come up with the characteristics of movies that earn:

- The Highest Revenue
- Popularity (IMDB Rating)
- Critical Acclaim (Metacritic Rating)
The production company also wants to know whether this is the right time to invest in the movie industry and what strategy they should use to maximize benefits.

# 2. Background
The dataset is taken from the IMDB database. It contains data of 1000 most popular movies(by IMDB rating) for the period 2006-2016.
IMDB (Internet Movie Database) is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos and video games, and internet streams, including cast, production crew and personnel biographies, plot summaries, trivia, and fan reviews and ratings.

Users registered on this site are invited to rate any film on a scale of 1 to 10, and the totals are converted into a weighted mean-rating that is displayed beside each title.

It also displays the Metascore of each title. Metascore is the rating given by another movie rating company called Metacritic. However, unlike IMDB, they get ratings from registered well known rating agencies and calculates a weighted average of those ratings.
